## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the interfacing and control of the following peripherals and systems:

- **7-Segment Display**: Display numeric data with direct GPIO control.
- **Keypad**: Interface and read input from a 4x4 matrix keypad.
- **Push Button**: Simple digital input for user interaction.
- **I2C**: Communication with I2C devices such as EEPROMs and sensors.
- **USART**: Serial communication for data exchange between the microcontroller and external devices.
- **SPI**: High-speed serial communication with peripherals like ADCs and DACs.
- **GPIO**: General-purpose input/output for controlling LEDs, buttons, and other digital signals.
- **EXTI**: External interrupts for responsive and efficient event-driven programming.
- **Clock System**: Configuration and management of the microcontrollerâ€™s clock system for optimal performance.


## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you will need:

- **STM32F401VE Microcontroller**: The target device for the project.
- **STM32CubeIDE** or any other ARM GCC toolchain: To compile and upload the code.
- **Hardware Setup**: Depending on the peripheral, you may need additional components like a 7-segment display, keypad, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedKamalMohammedElSayed/Valeo-Labs-STM32F401VE.git
    ```

2. Open the project in **STM32CubeIDE** or your preferred IDE.

3. Build the project and flash it to your STM32F401VE microcontroller.

## Usage

Each peripheral is handled in its respective source file, and the main program (`main.c`) demonstrates how to initialize and use these peripherals together. You can customize the main program according to your application needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional peripherals to add, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
